Downloads, examples & support
=============================
There is no need for you to re-invent the wheel. Mollie has a
`ready-to-use PHP script <https://github.com/mollie/reseller-api>`_ lined up for you. Of course, you can also choose to
do the integration all on your own if the scripts don't meet your demands.

Are you using node.js? In that case, you can use the
`open source API-client for node.js <https://github.com/mvhenten/mollie-reseller>`_, which has been developed by
`Matthijs van Henten <https://github.com/mvhenten>`_.

Do you need support? Please don't hesitate to `contact us <https://www.mollie.com/nl/contact/>`_.
