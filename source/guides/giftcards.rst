Integrating gift cards
======================

Mollie supports processing gift cards handled by the Dutch giftcard broker Intersolve. At the moment, the following
brands are supported:

* Nationale Bioscoopbon
* Nationale EntertainmentCard
* Nationale Kunst & Cultuur Cadeaukaart
* Podium Cadeaukaart
* VVV Cadeaukaart
* Webshop Giftcard
* YourGift

If you need a different brand, please reach out to your account manager or our support department.

Using the Mollie Checkout, your customer can pay part of the payment using gift cards and pay any remaining amount due
using the other payment methods enabled on your website profile.

Contracting and settlement
==========================

In contrast to other payment methods such as iDEAL or credit card, Mollie does not handle contracting and settlement on
your behalf. You will have to set up the contracting yourself via the brand owner (e.g. for Podium Cadeaukaart, contact
Stichting Promotie Theater- en Concertbezoek). The brand owner will ask for your PSPID, a unique identifier. You should
provide the brand owner with your Mollie Partner ID to use as the PSPID.

If you already have a PSPID that you would like to reuse, contact your account manager at Mollie.

Once your account has been set up with the brand owner and you have enabled the gift card brand in the Dashboard, Mollie
will automatically verify the set up with Intersolve and enable the brand on your selected web site profiles once
everything has been set up by the various parties involved.

Settlement is handled by the brand owner and not by Mollie.
