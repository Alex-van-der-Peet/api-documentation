.. _overview:

Welcome to Mollie B.V's public API documentation!
=================================================

Mollie API: simple & powerful
-----------------------------

Use the Mollie API to integrate online payments by Mollie directly into your website or app. Mollie and your website
will communicate by sending HTTP requests back and forth.

This page provides an overview of the Mollie API. The topics in the chapter deal with a number of specific aspects of
the API. We recommend to read these topics entirely.

If possible it would be wise to leave communication at this level to our ready-made Clients. This allows you to still be
in control without reinventing the wheel.
