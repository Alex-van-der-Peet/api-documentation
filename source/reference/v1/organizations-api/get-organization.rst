Organizations reflect the legal entities associated with the Mollie account. Payments, Refunds, Profiles, Settlements,
all belong to an Organization, therefore it's often referred to as *Resource Owner*. The Organizations resource contains
basic information about the legal entity, as well as insight into the activation statuses of payment methods for
example. Mollie performs identity verification and business intent validation before accepting organizations and
transferring payments to them, in order to protect buyers.
