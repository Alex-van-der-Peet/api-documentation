Migrating from v1 to v2
=======================

Why upgrade to v2?
----------------------

The Mollie API ``v2`` offers some compelling new features compared to the older ``v1`` API:

* Fully supports multi-currency, e.g. you can create payments in non ``EUR`` currencies.
* Improved support for accessing large sets of objects, now uses cursor based pagination instead of count and offset
  based pagination.

Changes in v2
-------------

In general, the API has adopted the HAL specification, allowing you to discover new resources and follow links to new
resources while working with the API.

Several fields have changed too to support new features or to clear up confusing aspects of the ``v1`` API.

Amount changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All amounts in the API are passed as a map containing both a ``currency`` and a ``value`` property, for example::

 {
   "amount": {
     "currency": "EUR",
     "value": "10.00"
   }
 }

This would mean an amount of â‚¬10.00.

Note that if you specify an amount, you must specify the correct number of decimals. We strongly recommend sending
``value`` as a string. Note that even though most currencies use two decimals, some like JPY use none.

All amounts returned in the ``v2`` API will use this format.

Status field changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The statuses ``paidout``, ``refunded`` and ``charged_back`` have been removed.

If you want to see if a payment has been paid out, it will contain the ``settlementId`` property.

If you want to see if a payment has any refunds, the payment will have the ``refunds`` key in the ``_links`` property,
which will point you to the refunds resource where you can view the refund details.

If you want to see if a payment has any chargebacks, the payment will have the ``chargebacks`` key in the ``_links``
property, which will point you to the chargeback resource where you can view the refund details.

Renamed and changed fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``cancelledDatetime`` has been renamed to ``cancelledAt``.
* ``createdDatetime`` has been renamed to ``createdAt``.
* ``expiredDatetime`` has been renamed to ``expiredAt``.
* ``failedDatetime`` has been renamed to ``failedAt``.
* ``paidDatetime`` has been renamed to ``paidAt``.
* ``recurringType`` has been renamed to ``sequenceType``. This field is now always present. A one off payment (not the
  start of a recurring sequence and not a recurring payment) will have the value ``oneoff``.
* ``redirectUrl`` and ``webhookUrl`` are now part of the top level object for Payments.
* ``links.paymentUrl`` has been renamed to ``_links.checkout`` as per HAL specifications.

Removed fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``issuer`` has been removed from Payment responses. You can however, still pass it to the Payment Create API call.

New fields
^^^^^^^^^^

* ``settlementAmount`` has been added to the Payment, Refund and Chargeback API responses. This optional field will
  contain
  the amount that will be settled towards your account, converted to the currency your account is settled in. It follows
  the same syntax as the ``amount`` property.

  Note that for refunds and chargebacks, the ``value`` key of ``settlementAmount`` will be negative.

  Any amounts not settled by Mollie will be not be reflected in this amount, e.g. PayPal or gift cards.

Locale changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only full locales with both the language and the country code are supported, e.g. ``nl_NL``. Locales are always returned
as full locales.
