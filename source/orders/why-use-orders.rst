Why use Orders?
===============

* *Pay after delivery* payment methods like *Klarna Pay later* or *Klarna Slice it* are only
  available when using the :doc:`Create Order API </reference/v2/orders-api/create-order>`.
* Some payment methods communicate the order lines to the customer in the hosted payment pages or in
  an invoice.
* The order can also be inspected in the dashboard, where individual order lines can be shipped,
  refunded or canceled. This can also be done by using the API.
