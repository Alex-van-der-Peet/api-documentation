Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally, we will add new resources, new fields, or new possible values to existing fields to the v2 Mollie API. All
changes are documented here.

July 2018
=========

Tuesday, 31st
-------------

- Test payments are no longer cleaned up after 2 weeks. Just like live payments they will never be removed.

Thursday, 19th
--------------

- The :doc:`Get Settlement </reference/v2/settlements-api/get-settlement>` endpoint now returns the ``invoiceId`` if the
  settlement has been invoiced. The invoice is also available in the ``_link`` object.

Wednesday, 11th
---------------

- Added a new endpoint for updating Subscriptions. Now you can update a subscription when needed --
  for example when your customer switches price plans.

  For details, see: :doc:`Update Subscription </reference/v2/subscriptions-api/update-subscription>`

June 2018
=========

Monday, 25th
------------

- Added the new payment methods Giropay (``giropay``) and EPS (``eps``). Note that this method may not be available on
  your account straight away. If it is not, contact our support department to get it activated for your account.

- Passing a payment description in the form of ``Order <order number>`` will now pass the order number to PayPal in the
  *Invoice reference* field which you can search.

  the payment methods in the preferred order for the country.
